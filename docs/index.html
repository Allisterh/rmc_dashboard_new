<p>Duration is a measure of price sensitivity of bonds to interest rate
changes.The longer the duration or maturity of a bond, the more
sensitive is its price to a change in interest rates.</p>
<p>There are 4 types of duration considered in the literature: 1.
Effective Duration 2. Modified Duration 3. Macaulay Duration 4. Key Rate
Duration</p>
<p><strong>To set ideas below is an example of how to interpret
duration:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If modified duration is 1 (year) and interest rate change is
+25bp (= +0.25%), % change of bond price is equal to -0.25% (=
-1*0.25%).</p></li>
<li><p>If modified duration is 10 (years) and interest rates change by
+25bp (= +0.25%), % change of bond price is equal to -2.5% (=
-10*0.25%).</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>As at Sep-2023 <strong>Macaulay Duration</strong> for the reserve
portfolio was 1.88.<br />
</li>
<li>As at Sep-2023 <strong>Modified Duration</strong> of the reserve
portfolio was 1.41.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Convexity</strong> <em>Convexity is a measure of the
curvature of the relationship between the price of a bond and its yield.
It provides an additional refinement to duration as a measure of a
bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Convexity is typically expressed in terms of percentage, and it
represents the relative change the price of bond for a given change in
yield.</li>
<li>Effective convexity takes into account the modified duration and the
change in yield, providing a more accurate measure of a bonds price
sensitivity to interest rate changes.</li>
<li>Effective convexity provides a more precise estimate of the bond
price change compared to convexity, especially when the yield changes
are significant.</li>
</ul>

### Conditional Value at Risk/Expected Shortfall
```{r cvar}

htmltools::includeMarkdown('www/cvar.md')
```


### Duration Risk
Duration is a measure of price sensitivity of bonds to interest rate changes.The longer the duration or maturity of a bond, the more sensitive is its price to a change in interest rates.

There are 4 types of duration considered in the literature:
1. Effective Duration
2. Modified Duration 
3. Macaulay Duration
4. Key Rate Duration

**To set ideas below is an example of how to interpret duration:** 

1) If modified duration is 1 (year) and interest rate change is +25bp (= +0.25%), % change of bond price is equal to -0.25% (= -1*0.25%).

2) If modified duration is 10 (years) and interest rates change by +25bp (= +0.25%), % change of bond price is equal to -2.5% (= -10*0.25%).

* As at `r format(Sys.Date(), '%b-%Y')` **Macaulay Duration** for the reserve portfolio was 1.88.   
* As at `r format(Sys.Date(), '%b-%Y')` **Modified Duration** of the reserve portfolio was 1.41.


**Convexity**
*Convexity is a measure of the curvature of the relationship between the price of a bond and its yield. It provides an additional refinement to duration as a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes.*

* Convexity is typically expressed in terms of percentage, and it represents the relative change the price of bond  for a given change in yield.
* Effective convexity takes into account the modified duration and the change in yield, providing a more accurate measure of a bonds price sensitivity to interest rate changes.
* Effective convexity provides a more precise estimate of the bond price change compared to convexity, especially when the yield changes are significant.
